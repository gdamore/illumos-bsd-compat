illumos-bsd-compat README - Sep 3, 2014.

This tree is an extraction of some of the remaining ucb compatibility code
from illumos-gate.

These are the utilities that are not really "intrinsic" to illumos, but
which folks may still use.  The idea is that this represents a new
"consolidation" separate from illumos proper.

This builds like illumos-gate, and has packages.  However, it needs the
following to be installed on the build system:

	* pkg:/developer/build/onbld

Furthermore, "make all" will fail if run by itself on a system unless

	* pkg:/compatibility/ucb

is installed.  Alternatively, you can run "make install" which will populate
the proto area properly so the -lucb library can be found by the components
that need it.

Also, you'll need the appropriate C++ and C compilers.  It should use the
same as illumos-gate to build.

You'll want to use +t as an argument to bldenv, as we don't have tools.

None of these tools or the libraries have received more than cursory testing.
I don't use them, and I discourage their use in general.  Most people would
be better off if these are *NOT* installed on the system.  If you think
you need them, please consider carefully why that is, and if you might not
better be served by adopting newer alternatives.
