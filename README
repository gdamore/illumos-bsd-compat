illumos-bsd-compat README - Sep 3, 2014.

This tree is an extraction of some of the remaining ucb compatibility code
from illumos-gate.

These are the utilities that are not really "intrinsic" to illumos, but
which folks may still use.  The idea is that this represents a new
"consolidation" separate from illumos proper.

This builds like illumos-gate, and has packages.  However, it needs the
following to be installed on the build system:

	* pkg:/developer/build/onbld

Also, you'll need the appropriate C++ and C compilers.  It should use the
same as illumos-gate to build.

You'll want to use +t as an argument to bldenv, as we don't have tools.
