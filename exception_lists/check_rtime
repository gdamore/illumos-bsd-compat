# This file provides exceptions to the usual rules applied to ELF objects by
# check_rtime. All strings are Perl regular expressions that are compared to
# file paths. In addition to the standard Perl syntax, there is one extension:
#
#	MACH(dir)
#
# is expanded into a regular expression that matches the given
# directory, or a 64-bit subdirectory of the directory with the
# name of a 64-bit architecture. For example, MACH(lib) will match
# any of the following:
#
#	lib
#	lib/amd64
#	lib/sparcv9


# Directory hierarchies to skip completely
SKIP		^usr/src/			# no objects in source code

NODIRECT	^usr/ucb
