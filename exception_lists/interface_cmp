# This file provides exceptions to the usual rules applied to shared
# objects by interface_cmp. All strings are Perl regular expressions
# that are compared to file, version, and symbol names. In addition
# to the standard Perl syntax, there is one extension:
#
#	MACH(dir)
#
# is expanded into a regular expression that matches the given
# directory, or a 64-bit subdirectory of the directory with the
# name of a 64-bit architecture. For example, MACH(lib) will match
# any of the following:
#
#	lib
#	lib/amd64
#	lib/sparcv9
